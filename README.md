# About
This project uses Bootstrap Version 5.1.3 for the form styling. As the end-user types in the input field, the input is validated using Jquery to make sure the right information is being provided in each field. If the information isnt the right format or is left empty, the form cannot be submitted. After the form is successfully submitted, it gets sent to a PHP script for another round of validation before being sent by email to whatever Address is configured in the script. PHPmailer is used for the email sending so a local email server is not required.

**This project was built with:**
1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
2. [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
3. [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
4. [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)

# Getting Started
In order for the email function of this project to work you must have phpmailer installed. There are two ways you can accomplish this either through composer or downloading the phpmailer files and manually adding them to your server. The recommended way is to use composer. You can follow the guide [HERE](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-composer-on-ubuntu-20-04) to install composer and the instructions [HERE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer#installation--loading) to get phpmailer up and running.
